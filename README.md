# my-open-source-progress

This repository will act as a tracking tool for my open source contributions.

I will try to keep it up-to-date in the following aspects:
- Resources that i find that are good for beginner contributers.
- The list of repositories that i find interesting and i want to work on in the future.
- The repositories i'am currently working on.

## Resources:

Here are some resources I found to be helpful for me:

- [free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/) Read this if you do not know anything about open source contributions.
- [First contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project.
- [firstcontributions.github.io](https://firstcontributions.github.io/#social-share) contains a list of popular open source projects which can be filtered out based on the programming language you are comfortable with.
- Rule of thumb for first time contributors is to pick out any project which interests you and find the 'easy fix' or 'good-first' issues to start with.

## List of repositories that I think might interst me:

- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/contribute)
- [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/contribute)
- [allenai](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/contribute)

## Current Work:

- [Pandas open source contribution progress](https://github.com/rohit18115/my-open-source-progress/tree/main/pandas-contributions).
