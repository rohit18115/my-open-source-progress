# Pandas contribution progress

## As of May 26th 2022:

- Thought of starting with simple Documentation correction in the `DataFrame.rename` method [link](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/47030)
- The process of solving an issue is much more complicated then i had anticipated, so i will be reading the contribution guide before jumping into the issues. [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)
- Important links for making proper bug reports [link1](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) [link2](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports).
- And here is how an ideal bug report on pandas look like:
  - [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing.html#:~:text=Trying%20the%20bug%2Dproducing%20code%20out%20on%20the%20main%20branch%20is%20often%20a%20worthwhile%20exercise%20to%20confirm%20the%20bug%20still%20exists.%20It%20is%20also%20worth%20searching%20existing%20bug%20reports%20and%20pull%20requests%20to%20see%20if%20the%20issue%20has%20already%20been%20reported%20and/or%20fixed.) this makes an important step to writing a bug report and you need to check all of the reqirements mentioned here.
  - [Example](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/47138) it contains **pandas version check**, **reproducible example**, **Issue description**, **Expected behaviour** and **install version**.
- Good blog on properly debugging your code [link](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/)
