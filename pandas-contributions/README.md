# Pandas contribution progress

## As of May 26th 2022:

- Thought of starting with simple Documentation correction in the `DataFrame.rename` method [link](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/47030)
- The process of solving an issue is much more complicated then i had anticipated, so i will be reading the contribution guide before jumping into the issues. [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)
- Important links for making proper bug reports [link1](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) [link2](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports).
- Good blog on properly debugging your code [link](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/)
